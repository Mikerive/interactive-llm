# How to interact with the bot

Once you have it running [locally](/guides/run-local) or [use the live version](/guides/run-live), you can use it to chat with your bot.

### Save and load chat history

The bot conversation is not stored in any server. You need to save it locally if you want to keep it. You can also load a saved conversation. The conversation history is a JSON file that you need store in your computer.
